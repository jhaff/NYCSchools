Important points
===================
Given more time, I would have like to have incorporated the following features:

- Sort functionality (Searching / scrolling through almost 500 schools is tiresome and perhaps a clear use case of the app is that a user would want a way to quickly find the top performing schools.
- Ability to favorite schools (Using CoreData or some other persistence layer. That way, users can save their favorite schools without needing to screenshot them.
- Bars next to the SAT score numbers on the Details page (Give a visual representation of scores)
- Pull to refresh (This would call the API and reload the tableView)

- Unit tests (These are a must in any production app, but I ran out of time. See my contributions to Hacktoberfest to see that I know how to do testing well)
- Cleaner git commit history (Mostly committed to master, many WIP commits. This would not have flown in a team setting. However, again see contributions to hacktoberfest to see better commits, messages, PRs etc)
